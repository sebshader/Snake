This is a game of classic snake made in Processing and Java. The only system a binary has been tested on is OSX. On OSX the high scores file and source code are inside the bundle. 

To reset the high scores, delete the highscores.tsv file in the data folder. Snake will create a new highscores file the next time it is opened.
